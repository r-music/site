Music information retrieval is a recent study 
field, with a wide range of topics yet to be
explored. It combines computational tools with 
theory to amplify the utility and applications of 
music and audio data. These data have many forms
of representation, each one carrying different
levels of information. Music, for example, can be 
represented by music sheet, chords, lyrics, 
MIDI and audio files, and so on.

This blog has as its main goals to show how to extract
and explore these different type of data in R. Some of 
the packages used here are:

  - [`vagalumeR`](https://github.com/r-music/vagalumeR)
  - [`chorrrds`](https://github.com/r-music/chorrrds)
  - [`music21`](https://github.com/r-music/music21)
  - [`tabr`](https://github.com/leonawicz/tabr)
  - [`Rspotify`](https://github.com/tiagomendesdantas/Rspotify)
  - [`seewave`](https://github.com/cran/seewave)
